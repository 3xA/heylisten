# heylisten

heylisten.io

Create rooms, listen to music, watch videos etc.

To make it run you will need NodeJS (I generally use the latest stable but LTS should work)
and npm. Get api keys from youtube, soundcloud and viemo and put them in config.js file. Then simply run ``npm install --save`` in the folder where you cloned this repository and run heylisten.js script.


The master branch is the latest stable and the version that is currently running http://heylisten.io and dev is where I will be testing the newest features.
